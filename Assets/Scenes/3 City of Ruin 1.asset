  description: "\"After walking 300 miles, you come across the ruins of a small city
    that looks like it was destroyed in a war. You see abandoned vehicles sitting
    amongst the rubble of what seems like the town square. There is a clothing store
    with all of the clothes still on the racks and a grocery store with moldy food
    on the shelves. You assess that this city was destroyed quite some time ago.
    \n\nYou explore deeper into the ruins, coming across a school. As you get closer,
    you can hear children laughing and playing. You peer inside and see two children
    playing some kind of game using pieces of stones.\n\nYou enter the school and
    are greeted by the children. They invite you to play with them and show you around
    the school. \n\nThey tell you that the city was destroyed in a war, but they
    don't seem to know any more details. They seem happy and content in their little
    world and don't seem to be affected by the destruction of their city.\""
