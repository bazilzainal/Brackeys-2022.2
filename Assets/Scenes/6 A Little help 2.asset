  description: '""I.... don''t know"" you replied.


    ""How the hell are you out
    and about?"" asked Daryl


    "I.... don''t know" you answered again.


    Daryl
    slowly turns to Astria, giving her a slight nod.


    "Maybe we can use him"
    He softly said to Astria.


    He leads you to a large underground bunker, inside
    it you see about 50 people.


    As you walk past, everyone is eyeing you, nervous
    that a robot is in their presence.


    "Welcome to the resistance.." said Daryl.


    You
    arrive at a hangar, a pristine single propeller plane sits in the middle.


    "You''re
    in luck... We have a way to get to China."'
