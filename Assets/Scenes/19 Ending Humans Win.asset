  description: '"Daryl motions to you to cover him.


    You focus your laser beams
    on the D.E.M.O.N, distracting it as Daryl dashes towards the core and smashes
    the butt of his beam rifle on the terminal.


    He rips apart any cables he
    sees and the lights in the cavern go out one by one.


    ''Mother'' gets shut
    down.


    Daryl looks at Astria and you, panting heavily.


    "Now we rebuild
    the world...."'
