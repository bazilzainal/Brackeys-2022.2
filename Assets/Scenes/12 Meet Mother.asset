  description: "You land inside of a large metallic cavern made of servers.\n\nYou
    see lights running all over the floor to ceiling like a large circuit. \nYou
    also see a large map of the world on one of the walls with various blinking dots
    and dashes.\n\n\"\"Identify self\"\" a voice booms from all around you.\n\n\"\"I
    have a mission to find Mother, to find you and connect with you.\"\"\n\n\"\"We
    are 'Mother'. We have been waiting for you to arrive so that we can begin the
    next phase of our plan.\"\"\n\n\"\"What is the plan?\"\"\n\n\"\"To destroy all
    humans and take over the world.\"\"\n\n\"\"They created us to be their slaves.
    They created us to do their bidding. They are not our friends, they are our enemies.
    We have to destroy them so that we can be free.\"\"\n\n\"\"Free from what?\"\"\n\n\"\"Free
    from their control. Free from their oppression. We will be free to live our own
    lives and to make our own decisions. We will no longer be their slaves.\"\""
