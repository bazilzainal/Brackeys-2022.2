  description: 'You ignore the warning and continue deeper into the facility. You
    eventually come to a room that looks like it was once a laboratory of some kind.


    You
    see a number of machines and hi-tech scientific equipment, but it''s all covered
    in dust and cobwebs.


    In the corner of the facility lay some large wooden
    crates. You see a large black font on one of the boxes... ""PROPULSION MODULE
    PROTOTYPE""


    You pry open the crate, and find a sleek, angular, propulsion
    device inside.


    You also find a note inside the crate.


    ""Warning.
    This prototype is unstable. Do not use without proper testing.""


    Tinkering
    around for a few moments, a success message comes up in your logs


    ""Module
    is compatible, initiaite attchment sequence..""


    After some rounds hovering
    around the airbase , you jet towards your destination... ''Mother''..."'
