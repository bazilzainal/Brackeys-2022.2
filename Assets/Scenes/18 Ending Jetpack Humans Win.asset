    The Jetpack has just enough fuel left to amplify your Self Destruct Protocol.
    It tells you that the ''Brain'' of ''Mother'' is the core, in the middle of the
    cavern where all the circuits lead to.


    You fly towards the cavern ceiling

    You dive towards the core, with
    an explosion so large that the cavern started to fall apart..
