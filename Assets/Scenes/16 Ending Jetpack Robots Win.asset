  description: '"Daryl pulls out a communication device and activated a signal.


    The
    Task Drones in the cavern all turned towards the center of the cavern, where
    the ''Brain'' of ''Mother'' was.


    You decipher the signal. It was telling
    all the Task Drones to self destruct at the ''Brain''.


    Using the last remaining
    fuel in your jetpack, you propel yourself towards Daryl and snatch the device
    away.


    You turn off the Self Destruct command and look back to see the Task
    Drones coming to a halt.


    D.E.M.O.N charges towards Daryl and Astria, finishing
    them off with its lasers at point blank.'
