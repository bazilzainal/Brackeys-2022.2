  description: '"He falls to the ground with a thud and the laser rifle skitters
    across the floor out of his reach.


    Seizing this opportunity, you bolt out
    the nearest exit back out onto the streets, making your way further into the
    city''s ruins. You hear the sound of gunfire behind you, but you don''t stop.


    After
    a couple of hours scanning your environment, you see a sign that says <Tengah
    Airbase>.


    You search through your directory, and find out it used to be
    a military base used by the Air Force.


    30 minutes later, you arrive at
    Tengah Airbase. The facility is in a state of disrepair, but you think you can
    still make your way inside.


    As you enter, you hear a voice echoing through
    the facility. The voice is robotic, and it''s coming from a nearby PA system.


    ""Warning.
    *STATIC BUZZ* This facility is under Ministry of *STATIC BUZZ* D-d-defense control.
    Trespassers will be *STATIC BUZZ* P-p-prosecuted to the full extent of the law.""


    You
    ignore the warning and continue deeper into the facility. You eventually come
    to a room that looks like it was once a laboratory of some kind.


    You see
    a number of machines and hi-tech scientific equipment, but it''s all covered
    in dust and cobwebs.


    In the corner of the facility lay some large wooden
    crates. You see a large black font on one of the boxes... ""PROPULSION MODULE
    PROTOTYPE""


    You pry open the crate, and find a sleek, angular, propulsion
    device inside.


    You also find a note inside the crate.


    ""Warning.
    This prototype is unstable. Do not use without proper testing.""


    Tinkering
    around for a few moments, a success message comes up in your logs


    ""Module
    is compatible, initiaite attchment sequence..""


    After some rounds hovering
    around the airbase , you jet towards your destination... ''Mother''..."'
