  description: 'He falls to the ground with a thud and the laser rifle skitters across
    the floor out of his reach.


    Seizing this opportunity, you bolt out the
    nearest exit back out onto the streets, making your way further into the city''s
    ruins. You hear the sound of gunfire behind you, but you don''t stop.


    After
    a couple of hours scanning your environment, you see a sign that says <Tengah
    Airbase>.


    You search through your directory, and find out it used to be
    a military base used by the Air Force.


    30 minutes later, you arrive at
    Tengah Airbase. The facility is in a state of disrepair, but you think you can
    still make your way inside.


    As you enter, you hear a voice echoing through
    the facility. The voice is robotic, and it''s coming from a nearby PA system.


    "Warning.
    *STATIC BUZZ* This facility is under Ministry of *STATIC BUZZ* D-d-defense control.
    Trespassers will be *STATIC BUZZ* P-p-prosecuted to the full extent of the law."'
