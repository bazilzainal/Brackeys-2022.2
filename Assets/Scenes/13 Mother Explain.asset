  description: 'A large oval drone appears from the sea of computers, its gold plated
    armour catching shimmering.


    In the middle of its head, a single menancing
    red light beams danger to whatever it was cast upon.


    In a far corner of
    the metal cavern, Daryl peeks over some stalagmites and immediately crouches
    back down. He and Astria have been quietly following you all this while.


    ""That''s
    one big drone."" he tells Astria, who came along as backup


    ""It''s their
    new model. The D.E.M.O.N.""


    ""What does it stand for?"" Astria asks


    ""Death.
    Extinction. Mutilation. Obliteration. Now.""


    ""Nice."" Astria says as she
    rolls her eyes


    ""They''re not playing around anymore, that''s for sure.""


    ""Well,
    neither are we.."" Daryl checks his beam rifle


    He stands up and takes aim
    at the D.E.M.O.N, right in the centre of the red light.


    "Now or never..."'
